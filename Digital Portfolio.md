I had to ask myself if the job that I wanted was right for me. I had to read and understand this chapter, at the same time understand if my dream job was right for me. Luckily this chapter had exercises that could help me so I did those exercises. I feel that this path that I have chosen is right for me.

### 2. Skills and Interests

I had to make sure that the friends and family that I have are wise enough to give me advice. I tasked myself to ask them questions and also to complete the questions in this chapter. I ask them questions about what tools would they have used, and for those that are retired, I asked them for advice. In the end, I have realized that they are very useful when comes to giving advice.

My understanding of a CV was heavily misunderstood. I tasked myself by reading this chapter to understand what goes into a CV. I read the entire chapter and completed the exercises. I feel like I have grasped an understanding on what goes into a CV.

I was confused on what would the best layout would be to make my CV. So I tasked myself on what the best layout would be. I searched on Google Chrome and I checked on Microsoft Word. I found what I would assume would be the best layout and design for a CV that fits me
